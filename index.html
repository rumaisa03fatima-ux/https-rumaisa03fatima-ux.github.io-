    <h1>My Hobbies!</h1>
<p>Honestly, I am a jake of all trades with   too many hobbies, some of them are:</p>
 <ul>
        <li>Gradening</li>
        <li>Painting</li>
        <li>Crafting</li>
        <li>watching movies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I love these hobbies</h3>
<h5>These hobbies help me connect with nature, and free up my brain from all the worries of the world</h5>
